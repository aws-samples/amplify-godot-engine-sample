## AWS Amplify Godot Engine Template

AWS Amplify is a collection of cloud services and libraries for fullstack application development. Amplify provides frontend libraries, UI components, backend building, and frontend hosting for building fullstack cloud apps. This tutorial will teach you how to use Amplify's new code-first developer experience to build a fullstack application with data, authentication, and frontend hosting which are all deployed to AWS. If you're completely new to AWS Amplify, you may want to read more about [how it works and the concepts behind the second generation of AWS Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/how-amplify-works/concepts/), which this tutorial will use.

### Quickstart

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to AWS Amplify! In this quickstart guide, you will:
1. Build a game developped with the Godot Engine
2. Export the game for the Web platform 
3. Deploy the web game on AWS

#### Deploy a web game made with the Godot Egine on AWS

We've created a starter Godot Engine application to help get started faster. It used the [First 3D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/) presented on the Godot Egine docupentation. First, you will create a repository in your GitHub account using our starter Godot Engine template.
Quickstart

1. Create the repository

Use our starter template to create a repository in your GitHub account. This template scaffolds Godot Engine starter project with Amplify backend capabilities.

[<kbd>â€ƒ<br>â€ƒCreate repository from templateâ€ƒ<br>â€ƒ</kbd>](https://github.com/new?template_name=amplify-godot-engine-template&template_owner=aws-samples&name=amplify-godot-engine-template&description=My%20Amplify%20Gen%202%20Godot%20Engine%20application)

Use the form in GitHub to finalize your repo's creation.

2. Deploy your first 3D game

Now that the repository has been created, deploy it with Amplify.

[<kbd>â€ƒ<br>â€ƒDeploy to AWSâ€ƒ<br>â€ƒ</kbd>](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/create/repo-branch)

Select GitHub. After you give Amplify access to your GitHub account via the popup window, pick the repository and main branch to deploy. Make no other changes and click through the flow to Save and deploy.
