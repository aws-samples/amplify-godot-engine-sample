## AWS Amplify for Godot Engine - Sample

This project contains an AWS Amplify project sample to create, build, export and deploy Godot Engine projects on AWS.

It uses a sample game named [Squash The Creeps](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/3d/squash_the_creeps) from the [Godot Demo Projects](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects). You can learn how to build this game from scratch in the [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org) in the [Your first 3D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html) section.
